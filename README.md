#  Telecom Customer Churn Prediction  

##  Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **customer churn in the telecom industry** using **Machine Learning**. Customer churn is a critical problem for telecom companies, leading to revenue loss. By identifying **key factors influencing churn**, companies can take proactive measures to **retain customers**.

##  Dataset  
- The dataset contains customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and billing information.  
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (1 = Customer left, 0 = Customer stayed).  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `Tenure`: How long a customer has been with the company.  
  - `MonthlyCharges`: Amount paid per month.  
  - `TotalCharges`: Lifetime spending.  
  - `Contract Type`: Monthly, One-year, Two-year.  
  - `Support Calls`: Number of customer service calls.
